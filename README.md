# Assemble Frontend Developer Tech Screen

Welcome to Assemble's at-home proficiency challenge! This challenge will aim to gauge your knowledge on a few different metrics that we use. You will have 3 hours to complete the challenge and make your final commit.

This repo has a lot of structure put in place for you. We recommend looking over it thoroughly before writing any code, and don't be afraid to refactor any of the work that's already put in place.

Wireframes for each page, as well as a demo video of the completed project that goes through the app flow, can be found in the [public\assets](public/assets/) folder.

If you'd like to implement additional functionality, or change the functionality of this challenge, feel free! However, be prepared to discuss your reasoning for doing so. We like critical thinking. We don't like improper implementation without reason.

A partially completed but well thought-out solution to a task can be just as meaningful as a solution that completes the task but is not as well implemented.

## Submitting

You will have 3 hours to complete the challenge. Please commit your results to your own private Github repo as you go, at a minimum of 1 commit per hour.  Please invite "assemble-engineering" to your private repo. Then reply to techscreen@assembleinc.com with a link to your project in Github and any comments you would like to include. 

## Goals
Stated briefly, the core goal is to complete a functional app that has a data, view and logic layer. The app is a cart/checkout flow that is hitting an API endpoint.

The details for each task can be found on the [kanban](https://musical-sweatpants.assembleinc.com/), and include all the information you should need for completion. Use the board to help you stay organized, and make detailed commits as you progress. 

If you are able to complete all tasks within the 3 hours we'd like to see you implement a new component, feature, responsiveness, or refactor. 

Good Luck and have fun!
